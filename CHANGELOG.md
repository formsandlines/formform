## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `vmap-dimension` to calculate the dimension of vmaps (like `dna-dimension`) or get it from meta `:dim` cached by a vmap constructor (not for zero-dimension vmaps)

### Fixed

- Macros not recognized in ClojureScript

## [0.1.0] - 2023-05-07

First alpha release of the rewrite on Clojars. I advice against using it in any serious manner just yet, as there are still some rough edges, missing tests, unresolved issues, undecided questions and maybe also some outdated documentation.

However, you are welcome to experiment with the library (take a look at the [introduction](https://formform.dev/notebooks/introduction.html) first) and I am thankful for feedback of any kind, as this is my first real Clojure project.
