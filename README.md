# formform

<br/>

**formform** is a modular Clojure/ClojureScript library all about the 4-valued logic of cognition first introduced 2017 by Ralf Peyn in [uFORM iFORM](https://uformiform.info). In its core, the purpose of the library is to enable the representation, evaluation and algebraic simplification of all (undetermined, imaginary, unclear, …) FORMs that have been introduced in the book.

*Please note that this library is still in an alpha state and breaking api changes might happen (although I try to keep them to a minimum), so do not rely on it for your projects yet. Otherwise, make sure to follow the [Change Log](./CHANGELOG.md) where I document all breaking changes between releases.*

## Overview

The library is divided into 3 core modules:

* `calc`: calculate with the 4 value constants or create and transform value structures such as value tables/maps and what I call *formDNA*
* `expr`: construct, simplify and evaluate various FORM expressions or define and use powerful abstractions I call *symbolic expressions*
* `emul`: _(unreleased)_ emulate FORMal systems as cellular automata that can be composed à la carte from declarative building-blocks

In addition, the `io` module can read and print strings in *FORMula notation*, which is easier for end users to read and write

To visualize expressions, value structures and cellular automata, I created the [formform-vis](https://github.com/formsandlines/formform-vis) library _(wip)_.

As a helpful tool for researchers and enthusiasts and as a demonstration of the library's capabilities I have also created the [**FORM tricorder**](https://github.com/formsandlines/form-tricorder) (it still uses an old, but stable version of formform). It can calculate, represent and visualize FORMs using an older version of _FORMula_ syntax, which is explained in the app (click on `Show explanations`). A complete redesign of the app is coming very soon.

Further applications (like a cellular automaton) are listed on the [formform website](https://formform.dev).

## Goals

The main goals of formform are:

* to be correct and complete with regards to the calculus
* to be flexible and extendable enough for any imaginable application
* to provide a clear, simple and efficient API
* to provide reliable output that can be easily transformed and shared

Although I constantly try to improve performance, it is not a main goal and I am not qualified enough for sophisticated optimizations. You are very welcome to contribute in this area and correct my mistakes.

I do also want to stress that I am neither an academic mathematician/logician nor a professional software engineer. It is my ambition to reach the goals stated above as closely as possible, but you should make sure to double-check any results if you want to work with this library in a serious manner. I have written a lot of tests for each module in the `test/` directory, so you may use these as a reference point.

Another thing to keep in mind is that I made lots of unconventional creative choices in the design of formform. In many cases this is due to my own curiosity that I wanted to satisfy using the library as a tool for exploration. In other cases it is because I am building specialized apps on top of formform. Still, I always try to make it as useful as possible for most typical use-cases. Please let me know if you are missing something that would be useful to you and I see if I can implement it.

## History and Motivation

This library has become my personal project since I first began studying [uFORM iFORM](https://uformiform.info), published by Ralf Peyn in 2017. Ralf's “SelFis” *(visual interpretation of a partial System of the self-referential System of the FORM)* inspired me to develop my own [cellular automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) in the programming environment [Processing](https://processing.org) to dig deeper and gain a deeper unterstanding of these systems. 

Working with lookup-tables for FORM calculations was okay for a while, but also very tedious and impractical for my research, so I began working on some functions that would do the calculations for me. In 2018 I was finally able to implement an algorithm to calculate all _self-equivalent re-entry FORMs_ as described in uFORM iFORM. I immediately did countless calculations by hand and let Ralf also check that the algorithm is solid and its results are correct.

As soon as I was able to automate calculation with undetermined FORMs, I saw that there was much more potential in this and that it could be very helpful for other people who want to work with FORM logic as well. So I began working on a [JavaScript library](https://github.com/formsandlines/formform-js) to elaborate my ideas, which gradually became *formform*. Since its early development, formform has always evolved in a fruitful interplay with the applications built on top of it.

A first application that I have developed in parallel from the beginning was the [**FORM tricorder**](https://tricorder.formform.dev) – a swiss army knife for FORM calculation, representation and visualization. In September 2019 I was finally able to develop a new [cellular automaton for FORM logic SelFis](https://plotter.formform.dev) with *formform* that is much more user-friendly and much more versatile than what I have done two years earlier.

My experiments with rule extraction by bitmasking in CAs led me to a code format I call [**formDNA**](https://observablehq.com/@formsandlines/the-dna-of-4-valued-forms) that is an abstraction of the value table (I later found out that there is a very similar code format for CA rules called [Wolfram Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfram_code) that is expressed as a decimal number). It not only made my CA faster and more flexible, it also inspired me to create the **vmap**: a recursive variable/value map to visualize formDNA, that has great potential for pattern recognition in FORMs.

Many of these experiments have found their way into formform and made their _re-entry_ back into my apps and research. I would love to see this feedback loop expanding to projects from other people as well. :)
